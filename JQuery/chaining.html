	<button>Click to hide</button>
	<p>This is content to hide.Until now we have been writing jQuery statements one at a time (one after the other).However, there is a technique called chaining, that allows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same element(s).Tip: This way, browsers do not have to find the same element(s) more than once.To chain an action, you simply append the action to the previous action.
